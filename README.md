- ✨ Visual polish including section titles, glow effects, and card-based layout

## 🛠 Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with responsive design techniques)
- MP4 video format

## 🗂 Videos Used

Ensure the following videos are placed in the `assets/` folder:
- `MOV_to_MP4_0421.mp4`
- `CloudConvert_Video_1.mp4`
- `CloudConvert_Video.mp4`
- `Video_0421.mp4`

If your videos are in `.mov` or other formats, use [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) or any other tool to convert them to `.mp4` for best browser compatibility.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Make sure the video files are in the correct `assets/` directory.

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy this site using:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Your personal server

## 📌 Notes

- Some browsers may require `type="video/mp4"` rather than `video/quicktime`.
- Always check video encoding for browser compatibility (H.264 is preferred).
- Use `object-fit: contain` or `cover` to avoid distortion in video playback.
